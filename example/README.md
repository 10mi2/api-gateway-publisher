# Examples
These are intended to be some simple boilerplate examples of deploying an OpenAPI specification along with an API Gateway.  While working through examples, we have realized that a lot of the complexity lies in building out an API Gateway API with an attached OpenAPI Spec.  The goal is to ensure the utility of the microservices boilerplate site by also showing how to get the API Built with connected Documentation.

## Where to start
Start with the `ts-api` example first.  It is the most straightforward and has the fewest moving parts.

## Included examples
- Go simple API
- Typescript Simple API
- Typescript API where the doc is published through APIGateway Docs export
- Typescript Authenticated API where the doc is published through APIGateway Docs export
- Example where the OpenAPI spec is served from a URL in the gateway. (it's the petstore url)

## Please help add some more.
- Other languages via Api Gateway
- Could do a version with Cloudfront or an external API
