# Examples
These are intended to be some simple boilerplate examples of deploying an OpenAPI specification along with an API Gateway.  While working through examples, we have realized that a lot of the complexity lies in building out an API Gateway API with an attached OpenAPI Spec.  The goal is to ensure the utility of the microservices boilerplate site by also showing how to get the API Built with connected Documentation.

## Included examples
- Go simple API
- Typescript Simple API

## Please help add some more.
- We should add an example where the OpenAPI spec is served from a URL in the gateway.
- We should add an authenticated api and ensure we have the Cognito Auth example in the OpenAPI Spec.
- Other languages via Api Gateway
- Could do a version with Cloudfront or an external API
